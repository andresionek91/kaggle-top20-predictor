# Kaggle Top20 Predictor

This code was developed to be implemented at AWS Lambda. It executes the prediction step of a model developed from [Kaggle's second annual Machine Learning and Data Science Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2018).

To deploy this model we had basically two options:
1. Export the model as as serialized object, load into AWS lambda and start making predictions.
2. [Parametrize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametrization) the model and load all coeficients and intercept manually to Lambda.

I choose the second option because I want the model to be transparen to anyone. It should be clear what the coefficients are and how the score is calculated. A serialized model wouldn't let us see that in detail.

[All material regarding the model's development is available here.](https://www.kaggle.com/andresionek/what-makes-a-kaggler-valuable)

## Implementing the parametrized model as a AWS Lambda Function.
To get this model into production, we are creating a Lambda function that receives the input json through an API Gateway Integration, calculates the score and then returns it to the API. You can access the API by doing a simple POST with the input json at the body.

Instructions on how to deploy a model to AWS lambda were found on this [Towards Data Science post, by Ben Weber](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-science-for-startups-model-services-2facf2dde81d).

### Example of implementation
```
import requests
import json

def treat_input(input_json):
    treated = dict()
    for key, value in input_json.items():
        if key[0] == 'Q':
            treated[value] = 1
        else:
            treated[key] = 1
    return treated


input_json = {
    "Q1": "q1_other",
    "Q2": "q2_25_29",
    "Q3": "q3_united_",
    "Q4": "q4_other",
    "Q6": "q6_data_sc",
    "Q7": "q7_other2",
    "Q8": "q8_2_3",
    "Q10": "q10_we_rec",
    "q11_analyz": "on",

}

treated_input_json = treat_input(input_json)
header = {'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'}

url = 'https://tk9k0fkvyj.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/default/top20-predictor'

requests.post(url, params=treated_input_json, headers=header).json()
```
